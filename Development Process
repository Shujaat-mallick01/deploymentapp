Web Deployment Platform Architecture
1. Core Components and Responsibilities
The platform is divided into modular components, each with specific responsibilities and interactions orchestrated via APIs, message queues, and event-driven triggers.

Authentication/Authorization Service:

Handles user sign-up, login, and permissions using OAuth2 for GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket integration.
Manages API tokens and JWTs for secure access to the dashboard and API.
Integrates with a user database to store credentials and roles.


Git Integration Service:

Connects to Git providers via OAuth and webhooks to detect code pushes.
Clones repositories and triggers builds for new commits or pull requests.
Supports branch-based deployments (e.g., preview for feature branches, production for main).



Build Service:

Detects project type (e.g., React, Node.js, Django) and builds in a sandboxed environment.
Generates static assets or container images for deployment.
Logs build output and status (success/failure) to a centralized store.


Deployment Service:

Deploys static assets to a CDN or object storage.
Deploys backend containers to a runtime environment (e.g., Kubernetes).
Assigns preview and production URLs and manages domain mappings.


Backend Runtime Service:

Manages containers for backend applications (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java).
Integrates with load balancers for traffic routing.
Scales containers based on demand or predefined rules.


Database Provisioning Service:

Automatically provisions databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) based on project configuration.
Manages database connections, backups, and scaling.
Ensures tenant isolation through separate schemas or instances.


CDN Proxy and File Storage:

Serves static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images) with low latency via a CDN.
Stores build artifacts and backups in object storage.
Handles cache invalidation and content delivery optimization.


Domain and HTTPS Service:

Configures custom domains via DNS APIs (e.g., Cloudflare, Route 53).
Automates HTTPS certificate issuance and renewal using Let’s Encrypt.
Manages DNS records and propagation checks.


User Dashboard:

Provides a web-based UI for managing sites, deployments, domains, and environment variables.
Displays build logs, deployment status, and usage analytics.
Built as a single-page application (SPA) for responsiveness.


Monitoring and Logging Service:

Collects and stores build logs, deployment metrics, and runtime performance data.
Provides real-time status updates and error alerts.
Integrates with the dashboard for user visibility.



Component Interactions:

User authenticates via the dashboard → Authentication Service issues JWT.
Dashboard triggers Git Integration Service to connect a repository.
Git webhook notifies Build Service → Build Service runs in Docker, pushes artifacts to CDN/Storage.
Deployment Service assigns URLs and triggers Domain/HTTPS Service for custom domains.
Backend Runtime Service spins up containers, Database Service provisions databases.
Monitoring Service logs all actions and exposes metrics to the dashboard.

2. Technology Stack Suggestions

Why: Certbot automates HTTPS, Cloudflare simplifies DNS.


User Dashboard:

Tech: React with Tailwind CSS, Node.js backend for API.
Hosting: Served via CDN (Cloudflare Pages) or Kubernetes.
Why: React provides a responsive SPA, Tailwind speeds up styling.


Monitoring and Logging Service:

Tech: Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for visualization, Loki for logs.
Hosting: Self-hosted on Kubernetes.
Why: Prometheus/Grafana/Loki provide a robust observability stack.



3. CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Pipeline Overview:

Trigger: Webhook from Git provider on code push or pull request.
Build: Detect project type (e.g., via package.json, requirements.txt) using Nixpacks or custom logic.
Sandbox: Run builds in Docker containers with restricted permissions (no network access, limited CPU/memory).
Artifact: Push static assets to MinIO/S3, container images to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Harbor).
Deploy: Deploy static assets to CDN, backend containers to Kubernetes.
Notify: Update deployment status in the dashboard and store logs in Loki.


Sandboxing:

Use Docker with read-only filesystems and resource limits (e.g., --memory=512m, --cpus=1).
Apply seccomp profiles to restrict system calls.
Use Kubernetes namespaces for tenant isolation.


Caching:

Cache dependencies (e.g., npm, pip) in MinIO or Redis to speed up builds.
Use BuildKit’s cache mounts for incremental builds.


Parallelization:

Scale build workers using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
Queue builds with Redis or RabbitMQ to handle high load.


Failure Handling:

Retry failed builds up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
Notify users via dashboard and email (e.g., using SendGrid).



4. Handling Custom Domains

DNS Configuration:

Use Cloudflare API to add CNAME or A records for custom domains.
Validate domain ownership via DNS TXT records.
Poll for DNS propagation using a library like dns-packet.


HTTPS Setup:

Use Certbot with HTTP-01 challenge for Let’s Encrypt certificates.
Store certificates in a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets).
Automate renewal every 60 days using a cron job or serverless function.
Configure NGINX/Traefik to serve certificates for custom domains.


Challenges:

Handle DNS propagation delays by retrying validation checks.
Ensure wildcard certificates for preview URLs (e.g., *.preview.platform.com).



5. Scalability

Build Infrastructure:

Use Kubernetes with HPA to scale build workers based on CPU/memory usage.
Deploy workers across multiple regions for low latency (e.g., AWS EKS, GKE).
Use spot instances or preemptible VMs to reduce costs.


CDN and File Storage:

Leverage Cloudflare’s global CDN for static assets.
Scale MinIO/S3 by adding nodes or using managed services.
Implement cache invalidation with versioned URLs.


Backend Runtimes:

Use Kubernetes for horizontal scaling of backend containers.
Implement auto-scaling based on metrics (e.g., HTTP requests, CPU usage).
Use multi-region clusters for high availability.


Databases:

Use managed services (e.g., AWS RDS, MongoDB Atlas) for auto-scaling.
For self-hosted, use Kubernetes operators (e.g., Crunchy PostgreSQL).
Implement read replicas or sharding for high-traffic apps.



6. Security Concerns

Sandboxing Builds:

Run Docker containers with non-root users and minimal privileges.
Use gVisor or Firecracker for additional isolation if needed.
Restrict network access with --network=none or Kubernetes network policies.


Authentication/Authorization:

Use Keycloak for OAuth2/OpenID Connect.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for users and teams.
Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in HashiCorp Vault.


Content Validation:

Scan static assets for malicious scripts using tools like clamav.
Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) headers via CDN.
Validate backend code for vulnerabilities using static analysis (e.g., Snyk).


Backend and Database Security:

Isolate tenants using Kubernetes namespaces or separate database schemas.
Encrypt database connections with TLS.
Use network policies to restrict container-to-container communication.



7. Optional Features

Serverless Functions:

Use Cloudflare Workers or OpenFaaS for lightweight serverless APIs.
Allow users to define functions in Node.js or Python.


Form Handling:

Provide a form endpoint (e.g., /forms/submit) that stores submissions in a database.
Integrate with email services (e.g., SendGrid) for notifications.


Asset Optimization:

Use esbuild or terser for JS/CSS minification.
Compress images with sharp or Cloudflare’s image optimization.


Database Provisioning:

Automate database setup with Kubernetes operators (e.g., Postgres Operator).
Allow users to select database type via dashboard.


Environment Variables:

Store secrets in HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets.
Provide a dashboard interface for managing variables.


Rollback:
